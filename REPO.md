Activity: Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed.
Objective: Boost security by automatically pinpointing and reporting any vulnerabilities lurking within the project's codebase.
Approach: Develop a Git pre-commit hook script to trigger a security scanning tool (e.g., Bandit) whenever a Python file is changed and committed. Generate a CSV report containing the identified security weaknesses
Outcome: Security vulnerabilities are promptly detected and reported during the development process, improving overall code quality and reducing security risks.
Lessons Learned:
    Understanding of Git hooks and their usage for automating tasks.
    Familiarity with security scanning tools for code analysis.
    Experience in configuring pre-commit hooks to enhance code security.
    Knowledge of reporting mechanisms for identified security weaknesses.

Activity: Create a fuzz.py file that will automatically fuzz 5 Python methods of your choice. Report any bugs you discovered by the fuzz.py file. fuzz.py will be automatically executed from GitHub actions.
Objective: Identify and report bugs through automated fuzz testing of selected Python methods.
Approach: Develop a fuzz.py script to fuzz test days_between, getDevEmailForCommit, make_Chunks, getPythonFileCount, dumpContentIntoFile methods. Configure GitHub Actions to automatically execute fuzz.py and report any discovered bugs.
Outcome: Bugs and vulnerabilities are identified early in the development cycle, allowing for timely resolution and improved software reliability.
Lessons Learned:
    Understanding of fuzz testing concepts and techniques.
    Proficiency in developing fuzz testing scripts.
    Experience in identifying and reporting software bugs through automated testing.
    Knowledge of integrating fuzz testing into CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.

Activity: Integrate forensics by modifying 5 Python methods of your choice.
Objective: Enhance traceability and debugging capabilities by integrating forensics techniques into selected Python methods.
Approach: Modify five chosen Python methods to incorporate forensics instrumentation, such as logging and error handling mechanisms. Ensure modifications do not compromise method functionality.
